      <p>
        I'm Wanqi Zhao, a PhD candidate at TU Dresden working at the
        intersection of software engineering and robotics. I'm passionate about
        bringing modern technologies like ML and LLMs to traditional
        manufacturing, making industries smarter and more efficient. I'm also a
        full-stack software engineer with 5 years of experience in the industry
        before I started my PhD.
